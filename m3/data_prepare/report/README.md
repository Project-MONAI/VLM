# Data Preparation for Medical Report Generation

The generation of medical reports is grounded in the MIMIC-CXR-JPG database, specializing in chest X-ray imaging.
To refine the quality of the reports and eliminate noise, we utilize an enhanced text version developed by [DCL](https://github.com/mlii0117/DCL), and subsequently apply additional cleansing procedures to further optimize report accuracy.
